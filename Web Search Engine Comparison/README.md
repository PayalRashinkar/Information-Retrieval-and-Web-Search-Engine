# Web Search Engine Comparison

This project involves comparing the search results from Google with results from an assigned search engine (Bing, Yahoo!, Ask, or DuckDuckGo) based on a dataset of 100 queries. The goal is to evaluate the overlap and rank correlation between the results of the two search engines, providing insights into their effectiveness and relevance.
