# Web Crawling

This project involves building a web crawler that navigates through a list of URLs, fetches their contents, extracts links, and recursively processes them until the queue is empty. The crawler compiles statistics from the crawling results and outputs the accumulated data.

Designed to explore web-crawling techniques, the implementation demonstrates key steps such as URL extraction, content retrieval, queue management, and result analysis. This project supports multiple programming languages like Python, Java, and C++ for implementation flexibility.

Feel free to explore the source files and customize the crawler for your use case!
