# LLM Vector BD and RAG

**Building a Knowledge Base and Exploring RAG with Vector DBs
Overview**
Focuses on cutting-edge techniques for working with vector databases, web crawling, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The tasks are divided into three exciting components:

**Using Weaviate**

Explore the Weaviate vector database to store and retrieve data as vectors.
Perform similarity searches by vectorizing data and queries.
Learn the fundamentals of vector-based data storage and search.
Web Crawling

Use a Node.js package to crawl the web and compile a knowledge base.
This knowledge base can later serve as input to build a custom GPT model (outside the scope of this HW).
Get hands-on experience with web crawling techniques and data collection.
Performing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Leverage a Python module to implement RAG using a small, locally-hosted language model.
Understand how retrieval mechanisms enhance the capabilities of language models.
Learn integration techniques between vector DBs and language models.

**Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure the following tools and software are installed:

Git
Docker
Node.js
Python (or Conda/Anaconda)
Visual Studio 2022 (with Desktop development with C++ enabled)
Key Learning Objectives
Familiarize yourself with vector databases and their applications in modern AI.
Understand web crawling techniques to compile domain-specific knowledge bases.
Master retrieval-augmented generation to enhance small language models.
